# magento-magemonkey

This is a clone of EbizMarts MageMonkey with support for modman.

All rights belong to EbizMarts and the only changes we are making are:

* Adding a modman definition file for modman support
* Cleaning up file permissions
* Sticking it into a git repository so we can add it as a submodule
